Polipo installation instructions -*-text-*-
********************************

  $ make all
  $ su -c 'make install'
  $ man polipo
  $ polipo &

If you want Polipo to put itself into the background, you may replace
the last line with:

  $ polipo daemonise=true

On SVR4 systems (Solaris, HP/UX), replace the first line with
whichever works:

  $ make PLATFORM_DEFINES=-DSVR4 all
  $ make PLATOFM_DEFINES=-DSVR4 LDLIBS='-lsocket -lnsl -lresolv' all

Please see the comments in the Makefile for more details.

You can also use Polipo without installing:

  $ make all
  $ nroff -man polipo.man | more
  $ ./polipo &

You should then configure your user-agent (web browser) to use the
proxy on `http://localhost:8123/'.

You may make Polipo smaller by a few bytes by disabling features you
don't need; see the Makefile for details.

If you want to use an on-disk cache, you will need to create its root
directory:

  $ mkdir /var/cache/polipo/

You should then arrange for cron to run the following on a regular
basis:

  killall -USR1 polipo
  polipo -x
  killall -USR2 polipo

If you want to use a configuration file, you should put it in one of
the locations `/etc/polipo/config' or `~/.polipo'; you can also use
the `-c' flag to put it in a non-standard location.  See the file
the file `config.sample' for an example.

You might also want to create a forbidden URLs file, which you should
put either in one of `/etc/polipo/forbidden' or `~/.polipo-forbidden';
you can set the variable `forbiddenFile' in your config file if you
want to put it in a non-standard location.  See `forbidden.sample' for
an example.
